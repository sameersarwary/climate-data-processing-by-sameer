# Welcome to my Jupyter Book

This is a technical book which blend python syntax and text to show the reader how to access climate models remotely, make ensemble of multiple models, apply bias correction on a GCM/RCM or their ensemble. 

The first note book below shows how to access and process data from netCDF file, which is pretty much basic stuff. The second note book demonstrates much advanced syntax to do computations and bias correction.
